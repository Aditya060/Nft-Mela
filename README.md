An NFT Markteplace built on Tezos Blockchain using React and Smartpy.
Resources that I used to build this project

1)https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/create-an-nft-marketplace-on-tezos#getting-the-contract-data

The basic purpose of this project is to provide a marketplace for people to mint and buy NFTs.
The interactive UI built using react works with the two Smartpy contracts- Token and Marketplace which are deployed on ghostnet.
I used Tezos-Temple wallet for all the testing and minting purpose.

The live version of this project has been deployed on vercel and can be accessed here -> https://nft-mela-adityathapliyal999-gmailcom.vercel.app/
